# Black Screen and Crash

## My game opens to a black screen for a few seconds and then crashes!

Often this is caused by not launching **Skyrim Special Edition** via Steam at least once before starting the modding process. The steps to solve this issue vary depending on which mod manager you used:

### Vortex

Vortex, by default, uses the same location for configuration/INI files as unmodded Skyrim. You simply need to close Vortex, open Skyrim Special Edition Launcher via Steam, click `Options`, set your graphical properties, and then exit the Launcher. When you re-open SkyrimTogether via Vortex your problem should be solved.

### Mod Organizer 2

MO2, on the other hand, defaults to using custom INI location per profile. In the top-left of the MO2 window is a drop-down list of launch targets for Skyrim. One of the options should be **Skyrim Special Edition Launcher**: select this option and click `Run`. Once the Launcher is open, click `Options`, set your graphical properties, and then exit the Launcher. Chagne your launch target back to **SkyrimTogether** and click `Run`.
