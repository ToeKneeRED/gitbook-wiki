# Server setup

## Hosting a server

To host a server, you have two options: you can use a (free) server provider or you can host your own server.

### Third-party server hosting

If you choose a third-party server provider, we recommend you go with [playtogether.gg](https://playtogether.gg/) (a free, Skyrim Together-specific server hosting website). The setup for server hosting is significantly easier, so consider this option if you are not very handy with computers.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Playtogether.gg can't be used solely for playing with the same people in your LAN! \
It counts the internet connection (your house) as one Player and therefore kicks everyone from the server that uses this internet connection.
{% endhint %}

### Hosting your own server
