## Choose one option!

It's all about your personal preference. If you're not experienced with port forwarding, it's recommended to go with the ZeroTier option.

### [Option 1: Regular setup](regular-setup/) (with port forwarding)

### [Option 2: ZeroTier setup](zerotier-setup/) (without port forwarding)

### Option 3: Local setup (same network)
